Mapp is a mobile application for archaeological documentation. It is open source, produced under the GNU General Public License (version 3 or most recent version). It is intended to map artifacts and features in unit levels in sites excavated by the traditional American technique. 

Users upload images of levels and then highlight artifacts and features on them. They can also save notes about their levels. All of this data is saved to a Firebase database, so users can even view and edit it when offline and sync their changes online when an internet connection is re-established.
